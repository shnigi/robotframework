Repository for my Robotframework test scripts

To run robot tests use shellscripts. ./run_all_tests.sh will run all tests in test directory and put results to results folder.
Runninng ./run_single_test.sh "testname" will run test by name and
./run_single_test.sh ./tests will run all tests in test folder.
